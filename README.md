## Features
### Player Hitbox
Pixel-accurate player position.
### Target Positionals
Draw the positional regions (flank, rear, front) around a target with a rich set of options. Also draws a range circle around the target for melee attacks (2.1 yalms) and melee abilities (3 yalms).
### Ring
Draw a ring at a distance around the player or target. Can be useful for raid buffs with a limited range or area attacks centered around the target.
### Player Cone
Draw a cone from the player towards the target. Useful for landing conal or directional attacks.
### Job Profiles
Keep separate profiles for different jobs.

## Installation
Add as a custom repository:
```

```

## Something doesn't seem right...
~~Mechanics such as how conal attacks work and how hitboxes and attack ranges work
have been inferred with trial and error. This plugin might be wrong about some
game mechanics - if something appears off let me know by opening a GitHub issue.~~

This plugin has been updated by me (k-kz) for API8 - I didn't write it, and _probably_ can't help you. <br>
That being said, I'm willing to give it a try, so open an issue if anything seems wrong, and I'll see what I can do.

# Thanks
